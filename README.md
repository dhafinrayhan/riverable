# Riverable

An example Flutter project that integrates [Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) with [flutter_reactive_ble](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_reactive_ble).

## Setup
1. Run `flutter pub get` to get dependencies.
2. Run `dart run build_runner build` to generate required files. You can also run `dart run build_runner watch` to generate files and let [build_runner] watch for changes and rebuild if necessary.
